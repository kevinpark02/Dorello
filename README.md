Users can log in, sign up, or try the demo version of the application to use full features, using the buttons in the navigation bar. BCrypt secures the passwords  and randomly generates session tokens which are stored in cookies. The session tokens are destroyed upon logging out. 

* AWS S3 Image Upload

Users can upload their profile pictures. Implemented Rails Active Storage and set up a bucket in S3 to display the photo file in React.

In the model, has_one_attached association was made between the profile photo and the user

```
has_one_attached :photo
```

And if the user had a photo uploaded, the photoUrl attribute in the user slice of state was extracted.

```
if user.photo.attached?
    json.extract! user, :id, :email
    json.photoUrl url_for(user.photo)
else
    json.extra! user, :id, :email
end
```
